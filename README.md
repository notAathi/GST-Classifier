# GST-Classifier
A government sales machine learning classifier project that was built during a hackathon as a team. Contribution included building right pipelines and model selection with proper EDA for the Dataset provided by the government of INDIA. 

dataset D, which consists of: Dtrain A matrix of dimension R(m×n) representing the
 training data. Dtest A matrix of dimension R(m1×n) representing the test data. We have also
 provided corresponding target variable Ytrain matrix dimension of R(m×1) and Ytest with matrix
 dimension of R(m1×1). The objective is to construct a predictive model Fθ(X)→ Ypred that
 accurately estimates the target variable Y{i} for new, unseen inputs X{i}.


 The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of solving the binary
 classification problem presented in the competition. The challenge involves accurately
 classifying instances into one of two categories based on the provided dataset. Given the
 real-world importance of such classification tasks, an effective solution can have significant
 impact.
 The focus of this project is to explore algorithms, fine-tune them, and apply the most suitable
 model to the problem. In addition, the evaluation of the model's performance will be based on
 metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC, ensuring a well-rounded
 analysis of its effectiveness.
 In this report, we will describe the steps taken during data preprocessing, feature engineering,
 model selection, and performance evaluation, alongside the challenges faced and the insights
 gained throughout the process

the whole workflow will be mentioned in a pdf subsequently
